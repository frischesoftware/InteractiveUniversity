Detailed Info for the 5 pictures:

SQL: Text simplified as follows (all caps except "Keys")

SELECT * FROM A
LEFT JOIN B
ON A.Key = B.Key


Linear Optimization:

like depicted but with just 2 lines (leave out the outer line with the green area)
the area that's delimited by the 2 lines could be highlighted, as well as the intersection point
between the two lines


Regular Expression:
ok as it is


Porter's Five Forces
I've added a better example - the 4 outer elements should come from 3, 6, 9 and 10 o'clock, arrows pointing to the inner element

Leave out the text in brackets (Just "Potential Entrants", not "(Threat of Mobility)"), otherwise it's too crowded

all 5 elements are equally important, "Industry Rivalry" does not need it's own background.



Boston Box/Growth Share matrix

Leave out the "Low"s and "High"s; "CASH GENERATION" and "CASH USE", vertical is "Relative Market Share" or "Rel. Market Share" and vertical is just "Growth".

Instead of the money bag I need a Cow (as in "Cash Cow", that's what everybody recognizes best).
